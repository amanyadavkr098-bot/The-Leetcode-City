## Phase 0: Fix Current Issues (START HERE)

### 0A. Scale Up Monuments to Central Tower Visibility
- Current: VidhanaSoudha ~45 units, BangalorePalace ~55 units, Fort Walls ~9 units
- Target: All 3× scale — VidhanaSoudha 120+, BangalorePalace 100+, Fort Walls 25+
- Scale ALL scatter decorations (NandiBull, GatewayArch, ClockTower, TempleGopuram) by 3×

### 0B. Spread Custom Landmark Buildings Across Full City
- Current: `landmarkPositions` uses hardcoded radius `280 + random() * 260`
- Fix: Use `cityRadius * 0.4` to `cityRadius * 1.3` — landmarks fill the whole city footprint
- Ensure no landmark overlaps the river channel (|z| < 95)

### 0C. DailyQuestionsLandmark Hardcoded Position
- Currently at `[373, 0, -75]` — needs to be part of dynamic landmarkPositions
